Day 181:

Reading Psalms, chapters ['149', '150']:

  Chapter 149.

    1: Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the faithful!
    2: Let Israel be glad in his Maker, let the sons of Zion rejoice in their King!
    3: Let them praise his name with dancing, making melody to him with timbrel and lyre!
    4: For the LORD takes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with victory.
    5: Let the faithful exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their couches.
    6: Let the high praises of God be in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands,
    7: to wreak vengeance on the nations and chastisement on the peoples,
    8: to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron,
    9: to execute on them the judgment written! This is glory for all his faithful ones. Praise the LORD!

  Chapter 150.

    1: Praise the LORD! Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty firmament!
    2: Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to his exceeding greatness!
    3: Praise him with trumpet sound; praise him with lute and harp!
    4: Praise him with timbrel and dance; praise him with strings and pipe!
    5: Praise him with sounding cymbals; praise him with loud clashing cymbals!
    6: Let everything that breathes praise the LORD! Praise the LORD!
