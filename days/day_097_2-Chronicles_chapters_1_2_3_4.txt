Day 97:

Reading 2-Chronicles, chapters ['1', '2', '3', '4']:

  Chapter 1.

    1: Solomon the son of David established himself in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.
    2: Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to all the leaders in all Israel, the heads of fathers' houses.
    3: And Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, was there.
    4: (But David had brought up the ark of God from Kir'iath-je'arim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.)
    5: Moreover the bronze altar that Bez'alel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the assembly sought the LORD.
    6: And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.
    7: In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, "Ask what I shall give you."
    8: And Solomon said to God, "Thou hast shown great and steadfast love to David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.
    9: O LORD God, let thy promise to David my father be now fulfilled, for thou hast made me king over a people as many as the dust of the earth.
    10: Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this thy people, that is so great?"
    11: God answered Solomon, "Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may rule my people over whom I have made you king,
    12: wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like."
    13: So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.
    14: Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
    15: And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephe'lah.
    16: And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Ku'e, and the king's traders received them from Ku'e for a price.
    17: They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; likewise through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.

  Chapter 2.

    1: Now Solomon purposed to build a temple for the name of the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.
    2: And Solomon assigned seventy thousand men to bear burdens and eighty thousand to quarry in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.
    3: And Solomon sent word to Huram the king of Tyre: "As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedar to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me.
    4: Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God and dedicate it to him for the burning of incense of sweet spices before him, and for the continual offering of the showbread, and for burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths and the new moons and the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, as ordained for ever for Israel.
    5: The house which I am to build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods.
    6: But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to burn incense before him?
    7: So now send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
    8: Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And my servants will be with your servants,
    9: to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful.
    10: I will give for your servants, the hewers who cut timber, twenty thousand cors of crushed wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
    11: Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in a letter which he sent to Solomon, "Because the LORD loves his people he has made you king over them."
    12: Huram also said, "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.
    13: "Now I have sent a skilled man, endued with understanding, Huram-abi,
    14: the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father.
    15: Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants;
    16: and we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon, and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem."
    17: Then Solomon took a census of all the aliens who were in the land of Israel, after the census of them which David his father had taken; and there were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred.
    18: Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred as overseers to make the people work.

  Chapter 3.

    1: Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Mori'ah, where the LORD had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jeb'usite.
    2: He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
    3: These are Solomon's measurements for building the house of God: the length, in cubits of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
    4: The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house; and its height was a hundred and twenty cubits. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold.
    5: The nave he lined with cypress, and covered it with fine gold, and made palms and chains on it.
    6: He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold of Parva'im.
    7: So he lined the house with gold -- its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls.
    8: And he made the most holy place; its length, corresponding to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth was twenty cubits; he overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold.
    9: The weight of the nails was one shekel to fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
    10: In the most holy place he made two cherubim of wood and overlaid them with gold.
    11: The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits: one wing of the one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub;
    12: and of this cherub, one wing, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and the other wing, also of five cubits, was joined to the wing of the first cherub.
    13: The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits; the cherubim stood on their feet, facing the nave.
    14: And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and worked cherubim on it.
    15: In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each.
    16: He made chains like a necklace and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
    17: He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south, the other on the north; that on the south he called Jachin, and that on the north Bo'az.

  Chapter 4.

    1: He made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high.
    2: Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.
    3: Under it were figures of gourds, for thirty cubits, compassing the sea round about; the gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.
    4: It stood upon twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
    5: Its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held over three thousand baths.
    6: He also made ten lavers in which to wash, and set five on the south side, and five on the north side. In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.
    7: And he made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.
    8: He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
    9: He made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze;
    10: and he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.
    11: Huram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Huram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God:
    12: the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
    13: and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.
    14: He made the stands also, and the lavers upon the stands,
    15: and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it.
    16: The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD.
    17: In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zer'edah.
    18: Solomon made all these things in great quantities, so that the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.
    19: So Solomon made all the things that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence,
    20: the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed;
    21: the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold;
    22: the snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of pure gold; and the sockets of the temple, for the inner doors to the most holy place and for the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold.
